# Symbolic Differentiator

An implementation of Differential Calculus to illustrate symbol manipualtion and data abstraction.

## Differentiation with abstract data
We first define a differentiation algorithm that operates on abstract objects such as “sums,” “products,” and “variables” without worrying about how these
are to be represented.

The following reduction rules can be applied to differentiate any algebraic sum or product:
